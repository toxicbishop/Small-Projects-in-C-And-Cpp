## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler (MinGW on Windows, or any C compiler)

### Compilation

```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd Project-Folder-Name

# Compile the program
gcc program-name.c -o program-name

# Example: Compile the number guessing game
cd Number-Guessing-Game
gcc Num-guessing-game.c -o Num-guessing-game
```

### Running

```bash
# Run the compiled executable
./program-name

# On Windows
program-name.exe
```
