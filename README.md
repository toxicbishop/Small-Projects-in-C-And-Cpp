## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler (MinGW on Windows, or any C compiler) for C projects.
- GCC++ or equivalent for C++ projects.

### Compilation

```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd C/Project-Folder-Name

# Compile the program
gcc program-name.c -o program-name

# Example: Compile the number guessing game
cd C/Number-Guessing-Game
gcc Num-guessing-game.c -o Num-guessing-game
```

### Running

```bash
# Run the compiled executable
./program-name

# On Windows
program-name.exe
```

## Learning Objectives

These projects help you practice:

- ✅ Basic C syntax and structure
- ✅ Control flow (if-else, switch, loops)
- ✅ Functions and modular programming
- ✅ File I/O operations
- ✅ Random number generation
- ✅ User input handling
- ✅ Time and date functions

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/toxicbishop/Small-Projects-in-C.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Small-Projects-in-C
   ```

3. Choose a project and navigate to its folder:

   ```bash
   cd Number-Guessing-Game
   ```

4. Compile and run.
